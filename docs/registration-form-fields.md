    - If by Card or Bank account we send them to Stripe to finish paying. We can send stripe the exact amount. We add 3% if paying by card. Stripe sends a webhook back to let us know if it was successful or not.
    - If paying by Zelle, Check, or Pay Later (special cases only) then we just send an email to the admin to let them know a user has requested that option. Also send an email to the new member's email on file.
